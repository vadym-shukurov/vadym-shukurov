# Vadym Shukurov | Engineering Leader

> **Engineering Execution & Platform Strategy.** I build high-trust, high-autonomy engineering cultures centered on the **"You Build It, You Own It"** philosophy. I specialize in transforming legacy release cycles into high-velocity, Continuous Delivery engines that align technical execution with business ROI.

### 🚀 Key Impact Metrics
* **Continuous Delivery:** Transitioned organizations from biannual releases to a predictable ~3-week heartbeat, moving toward daily CI/CD
* **Reliability & Ownership:** Reduced critical incidents by ~20% YoY by shifting operational responsibility and incident response to the squads
* **Quality Excellence:** Scaled unit test coverage from ~6% to 63%+ (85%+ on new code) to enable safe, autonomous deployments
* **Efficiency:** Operationalized AI-assisted engineering practices, reducing defects found in staging/QA by ~50%

### 🧠 Modern Engineering Philosophy
* **You Build It, You Own It:** I empower squads to own the full lifecycle—from architectural design to production monitoring and on-call
* **Small Batch Delivery:** I favor small, low-risk code chunks over "Big Bang" releases to minimize blast radius and increase feedback loops
* **DevEx as a Force Multiplier:** I believe the best engineering standards are those baked into the "Paved Road" of internal tooling
