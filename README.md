### Engineering Leader | Building High-Trust, High-Scale Systems through Stewardship and Blameless Culture

I believe engineering leadership is a product. I open-source my management and architectural frameworks to foster transparency, scale engineering excellence, and help other leaders move from "Gatekeeping" to "Stewardship."

## 🚀 Key Impact Metrics
* **Continuous Delivery:** Transitioned organizations from biannual releases to a predictable ~3-week heartbeat, moving toward daily CI/CD.
* **Reliability & Ownership:** Reduced critical incidents by ~20% YoY by shifting operational responsibility and incident response to the squads.
* **Quality Excellence:** Scaled unit test coverage from ~6% to 63%+ (85%+ on new code) to enable safe, autonomous deployments.
* **Efficiency:** Operationalized AI-assisted engineering practices, reducing defects found in staging/QA by ~50%.

---

## 🧠 Modern Engineering Philosophy
* **You Build It, You Own It:** I empower squads to own the full lifecycle—from architectural design to production monitoring and on-call.
* **Small Batch Delivery:** I favor small, low-risk code chunks over "Big Bang" releases to minimize blast radius and increase feedback loops.
* **DevEx as a Force Multiplier:** I believe the best engineering standards are those baked into the "Paved Road" of internal tooling.
