### Engineering Leader | Building High-Trust, High-Scale Systems through Stewardship and Blameless Culture

I believe engineering leadership is a product. I open-source my management and architectural frameworks to foster transparency, scale engineering excellence, and help other leaders move from "Gatekeeping" to "Stewardship."

## 🚀 Key Impact Metrics
* **Continuous Delivery:** Transitioned organizations from biannual releases to a predictable ~3-week heartbeat, moving toward daily CI/CD.
* **Reliability & Ownership:** Reduced critical incidents by ~20% YoY by shifting operational responsibility and incident response to the squads.
* **Quality Excellence:** Scaled unit test coverage from ~6% to 63%+ (85%+ on new code) to enable safe, autonomous deployments.
* **Efficiency:** Operationalized AI-assisted engineering practices, reducing defects found in staging/QA by ~50%.

---

## 🧠 Modern Engineering Philosophy
* **You Build It, You Own It:** I empower squads to own the full lifecycle-from architectural design to production monitoring and on-call.
* **Small Batch Delivery:** I favor small, low-risk code chunks over "Big Bang" releases to minimize blast radius and increase feedback loops.
* **DevEx as a Force Multiplier:** I believe the best engineering standards are those baked into the "Paved Road" of internal tooling.

## 📂 Featured Leadership Playbooks

### 🏗️ Architecture & Strategy
* **[System-Design-Governance](https://github.com/vadym-shukurov/System-Design-Governance):** My framework for Technical Density. Focuses on DDD, Service Objects, and Anti-Corruption Layers to prevent "Big Ball of Mud" architectures.
* **[Strategic-Hiring-and-Capacity-Planning](https://github.com/vadym-shukurov/Strategic-Hiring-and-Capacity-Planning):** Data-driven headcount planning, 70/20/10 resource allocation, and 30-60-90 day onboarding for autonomous stewardship.

### 🛡️ Quality & Governance
* **[Quality-Strategy-Vision](https://github.com/vadym-shukurov/quality-strategy-and-vision):** Executive framework for high-traffic SaaS quality, combining Risk-Based Testing with failure tolerance and AI safety.
* **[AI-Governance-in-SDLC](https://github.com/vadym-shukurov/ai-engineering):** Guardrails for implementing AI-supported PR reviews and coding while maintaining security and architectural integrity.

### 👥 Management & Culture
* **[Management-And-Culture](https://github.com/vadym-shukurov/management-and-culture):** My core framework for 1-on-1s, team-led onboarding, and building a blameless culture.
* **[Service Ownership Model](https://github.com/vadym-shukurov/service-ownership-model):** Moving beyond gatekeeping to a "Ownership" model using [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/vadym-shukurov/management-and-culture/blob/main/technical-strategy/code-guardianship.md) and automated quality gates.

## 🧪 Technical Showcases
* **[eCoffee-E2E](https://github.com/vadym-shukurov/eCoffee-E2E):** Enterprise-grade iOS UI Automation demonstrating XCUITest, Page Object Model, and CI/CD integration.
* **arkiv-sre-blueprint**: Production-grade GitOps + SRE reference stack (Kind + Argo CD ApplicationSet + SOPS/age + CI + SLO burn-rate alerts + Grafana dashboards + runbooks + GameDay incident drill + postmortem).  
[Repo: Arkiv-SRE-Blueprint](https://github.com/vadym-shukurov/arkiv-sre-blueprint) - What it demonstrates: owning production end-to-end (reproducibility, observability, reliability, incident response).
  I build and operate production platforms with an SRE mindset: GitOps, observability (SLIs/SLOs), incident response, and secure delivery pipelines.  
**Recent example:** `arkiv-sre-blueprint` — a reproducible, end-to-end platform blueprint with Argo CD, SOPS, CI, SLO burn-rate alerting, dashboards, runbooks, and GameDay drills.

**Strengths:** production ownership, reliability engineering, Kubernetes/GitOps, incident response, and growing teams that ship and operate what they build.
